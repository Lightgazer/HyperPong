# HyperPong
My pong game variant. I made this game to learn the basics of Unity. I also studied and tried to implement the principles of SOLID.

The player controls the sphere, not the paddle. The sphere is more difficult to push the ball in the desired direction, but the player can use the pulling ability. The use of the ability is not infinite and spends energy.
